# RMarkdown {#rmarkdown}

TODO: move count and uncount to the pivot table summary statistics chapter

## Summary (a few sentences)

Here we'll learn RMarkdown, which helps you tell a story with your data analysis because you can write text alongside the code.

## Objectives (more detailed, bulletpoints?)

## Resources

## Intro to RMarkdown

TODO (write out): 
Intro, knitting
How it’s different from R Script (which  we just created)
How in-line figures are awesome (no copy-pasting from excel to word)
Reproducibility is important (this might be new to some people). Reproducible research/self-contained Rmd files: read in data at the top. Read_csv.

An RMarkdown file will allow us to weave markdown text with chunks of R code to be evaluated and output content like tables and plots.

File -> New File -> RMarkdown... -> Document of output format HTML, OK.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_new-rmd-doc-html.png")  
```


You can give it a Title like "My Analysis". Then click OK. 

OK, first off: by opening a file, we are seeing the 4th pane of the RStudio console, which is essentially a text editor. This lets us organize our files within RStudio instead of having a bunch of different windows open.

Let's have a look at this file — it's not blank; there is some initial text is already provided for you. Notice a few things about it: 

- There are white and grey sections. R code is in grey sections, and other text is in white. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown.png")  
```


<br>

Let's go ahead and "Knit HTML" by clicking the blue yarn at the top of the RMarkdown file. 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown_side_by_side.png")  
```


What do you notice between the two? So much of learning to code is looking for patterns.

Notice how the grey **R code chunks** are surrounded by 3 backticks and `{r LABEL}`. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of `summary(cars)` and the output plot in the case of `plot(pressure)`.

Notice how the code `plot(pressure)` is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option `echo=FALSE`. 

The hashtag (#) at lines 12 and 22 cause the following text to be displayed larger and in bold. 

This RMarkdown file has 2 different languages within it: **R** and **Markdown**. 

We don't know that much R yet, but you can see that we are taking a summary of some data called 'cars', and then plotting. We will focus on R for the rest of the workshop, but for the rest of this morning let's focus on the second language.

The second language is Markdown. This is a formatting language for plain text, and there are only about 15 rules to know. 

Notice the syntax for:

- **headers** get rendered at multiple levels: `#`, `##`
- **bold**: `**word**`

There are some good [cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio: Go to Help > Markdown Quick Reference

**Important**: note that the hashtag `#` is used differently in Markdown and in R: 

- in R, a hashtag indicates a comment that will not be evaluated. You can use as many as you want: `#` is equivalent to `######`. It's a matter of style. I use two `##` to indicate a comment so that it's clearer what is a comment versus what I don't want to run at the moment.
- in Markdown, a hashtag indicates a level of a header. And the number you use matters: `#` is a "level one header", meaning the biggest font and the top of the hierarchy. `###` is a level three header, and will show up nested below the `#` and `##` headers.

If this seems confusing, take comfort in the fact that you are already used to using `#`s differently in real life: it can mean "number" or "pound" or hashtags on social media.

### Activity

1. In Markdown write some italic text, make a numbered list, and add a few subheaders.
 Use the Markdown Quick Reference (in the menu bar: Help > Markdown Quick Reference). 
1. Reknit your html file. 


### Code chunks

OK. Now let's practice with some of those commands that we were working on this morning.

Create a new chunk in your RMarkdown first in one of these ways: 

- click "Insert > R" at the top of the editor pane
- type by hand 
   \```{r}
   \```
- if you haven't deleted a chunk that came with the new file, edit that one

Now, let's write some R code. 

```
x <- seq(1:15)
```

Now, hitting return does not execute this command; remember, it's a text file in the text editor, it's not associated with the R engine. To execute it, we need to get what we typed in the the R chunk (the grey R code) down into the console. How do we do it? There are several ways (let's do each of them):

1. copy-paste this line into the console.
1. select the line (or simply put the cursor there), and click 'Run'. This is available from 
    a. the bar above the file (green arrow)
    b. the menu bar: Code > Run Selected Line(s)
    c. keyboard shortcut: command-return
1. click the green arrow at the right of the code chunk

### Activity

> Add a few more commands to your file from this morning. Execute them by trying the three ways above. Then, knit your R Markdown file, which will also save the Rmd by default. 

## Create a Rmd for our fish analysis

OK now let's open a new RMarkdown file and begin some analyses. 

- read in
- View()

fish_counts are what we call Tidy Data. 

## Tidy data

Tidy data has a simple convention: put variables in the columns and observations in the rows.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy_data.png")  
```


Uncount this data so that we can use it with pivot tables

TODO: 
Explore data: 
summaries/data table
Uncount and count
Why would you ever want to uncount? You don’t want to assume how future you will want to use this data
How easy is it to get these counts by different groupings
Simplest ggplot (introduced in readxl chapter)

## Activity

1. knit!

## Fun facts (quirky things) - making a note of these wherever possible for interest (little “Did you know?” sections)
## Interludes (deep thoughts/openscapes)
## Interludes (deep thoughts/openscapes)

Comments! Organization (spacing, subsections, vertical structure, indentation, etc.)! Well-named variables! Also, well-named operations so analyses (select(data, columnname)) instead of data[1:6,5] and excel equivalent. (Ex with strings)
Not so brittle/sensitive to minor changes.
