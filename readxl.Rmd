# `readxl` {#readxl}
Note for Allison: the `{#readxl}` above lets us reference it from another chapter...not sure how much we'll use it but it's possible (and doesn't hurt to have). Cool, thanks Julie! 

## Summary (a few sentences)

The **readxl** package makes it easy to import tabular data from Excel spreadsheets (.xls or .xlsx files) and includes several options for cleaning data during import. **readxl** has no external dependencies and functions on any operating system, making it an OS- and user-friendly package that simplifies getting your data from Excel into R. 

## Objectives (more detailed, bulletpoints?)

- Use readxl::read_excel() to read in an entire spreadsheet
- Use readxl::read_excel() to read in pieces of a spreadsheet
- Specify column names when importing Excel data
- Replace a specific string/value with 'NA' 
- Skip *n* rows when importing
- Read in multiple worksheets (note to Julie: I actually think this is fine to include...purrr::map() can be explained in a really simple way)
