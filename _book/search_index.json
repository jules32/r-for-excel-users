You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 5. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

Cool, thanks Julie! 5.1 Summary (a few sentences) The readxl package makes it easy to import tabular data from Excel spreadsheets (.xls or .xlsx files) and includes several options for cleaning data during import. readxl has no external dependencies and functions on any operating system, making it an OS- and user-friendly package that simplifies getting your data from Excel into R. 5.2 Objectives (more detailed, bulletpoints?) Use readxl::read_excel() to read in an Excel worksheet Use readxl::read_excel() to read in parts of a worksheet (by cell range) Specify column names when importing Excel data Replace a specific string/value with ‘NA’ Skip n rows when importing an Excel worksheet Read in multiple Excel worksheets (note to Julie: I actually think this is fine to include…purrr::map() can be explained in a really simple way) Something about readxl workflows (e.g. %&gt;% write_csv()) 5.3 Resources https://readxl.tidyverse.org/ 5.4 Lessons teaching for each objective…..

Being a nimble useR means being able to navigate/keep tabs on this ecosystem and find what you need. It also means working reproducibly, so you can re-run and update things more easily.

How recently was it worked on? Does it interface with tidyverse? Click on “news” Takes me here. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awalker89/openxlsx/master/NEWS . Not useful. But from this URL, - I see the username so I can edit this url to be https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx/ 1st thing: most recent commit was a year ago. Can poke around more, are there issues open, are they taken care of? Etc. I will probably not pursue using this right now.
