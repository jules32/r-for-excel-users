# Dplyr and Pivot Tables {#pivot}

## Summary (a few sentences)

First of two chapters on data wrangling, here focused on pivot tables. 

## Objectives (more detailed, bulletpoints?)

In R, we can use dplyr for pivot tables by using 2 main verbs in combination: `group_by` and `summarize`, and that's where we'll start. Then, we will learn 2 critical verbs that you will use all the time: `select` and `mutate`.

## Introduction / our analytical plan

We are going to continue with our analysis with the fish-counts data. So far, our RMarkdown has the following in the "setup" chunk: <!---TODO update after ch 3 complete --->

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
## attach libraries
library(tidyverse)

## read in data
fish_counts <- read_csv("fish_counts_curated.csv")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Teaching version
fish_counts <- read_csv("curation/fish_counts_curated.csv")
```

And we have explored the data by looking at some summary statistics and making a simple plot. Now, we are going to learn how to wrangle data in R, using the `dplyr` package which is included in the `tidyverse`. In this session, we'll focus on the functions in `dplyr` that operate like pivot tables.

This is because what we want to do with our fish_counts data is XXXXX. 

## What are pivot tables?

- what they are
- what they allow you to do

Let's talk about how this looks like in R. 

## dplyr for pivot tables

In R, we can use dplyr for pivot tables by using 2 main verbs in combination: `group_by` and `summarize`. Here is what this looks like:

`group_by` and `summarize` are the main ingredients for pivot tables: 

- **`group_by()`**: TODO: words here, screenshot without computed column!

  `r htmltools::img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-summarise.png', width=300)`

- **`summarize()`**: collapse many values down to a single summary 

  `r htmltools::img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-summarise.png', width=300)`
  
### group_by() summarize()  
  
Say it with me: pivot tables are "group_by summarize". And just like pivot tables, you have flexibility with how you are going to summarize. For example, we can calculate an average, or a total.

Let's try this on our fish_counts data. Let's summarize this data by calculting the the total number of fish by type, which in our dataframe is called `common_name`. We'll use the pipe operator `%>%`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fish_counts %>%
  group_by(common_name) %>%
  summarize(total_fish = sum(total_count)) # within summarize, we name a new column and calculate the sum.
```

Way more seniorita fish than any other kind! 

Notice how together, group_by and summarize collapse the amount of information we see. We lose the other columns that aren't involved here; we no longer have `year`, `common_name`, or `total_count`. 

<!---
Question: What if you *don't* group_by first?

```
fish_counts %>%
  summarize(total_fish = sum(total_count))
```
--->

Awesome! And we can still `View(fish_counts)` and see that we haven't changed any of our original data. But maybe we do want to save this summary as a variable so we can refer to it or even include it in further analyses. So let's add a variable assignment to that first line:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
common_name_summary <- fish_counts %>%
  group_by(common_name) %>%
  summarize(total_fish = sum(total_count))
```
  
Now let's summarize by site. We will assign it to a variable called `site_summary`. How do we do that? 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
site_summary <- fish_counts %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarize(total_fish = sum(total_count))
```
  
Great. It can be useful to summarize by both site and year, so that we can learn a little more about how things change over time across sites. And we are able to group_by more than one variable. Let's do this together, and assign this to a new variable called `site_year_summary`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
site_year_summary <- fish_counts %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(total_fish = sum(total_count))
```

OK, so this is awesome. We can see the total counts for each site by year, and have this saved here in a nice variable. 

We will revisit this in a moment, but now let's move on to our next dplyr verb. 

### mutate()

We use the `mutate()` function to add columns to a data frame. This is one of the most common things that I do in Excel: you need to name the new column, and then you can fill it with new values. 

Let's say we need to a column with the observers SCUBA diver's who observed all these fish. We use the mutate function, and inside it we will first name the column (`observer_name`) and then we'll name the observer (`"`) We put the name of this person in quote

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fish_counts %>%
  mutate(observer_name = "Julie")

```


Now let's use mutate in combination with group_by. We are going to add a new column with total counts, calculated after grouping by site and year. Let's have a look at it first, and then we will assign it as a variable in a moment.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fish_counts %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  mutate(total_fish = sum(total_count))
```

We now have an additional column in our dataframe called `total_fish`. If we recall from our `site_year_summary`, this has all the same information. But instead of collapsing our dataframe, we retain all of the information from the other columns, and the `total_fish` column will have values that are repeated. 

So in a case like this, why would you ever want to have this `total_fish` column with values repeated? Why wouldn't you always do group_by summarize rather than group_by mutate?

### mutate() vs summarize()

Why would you use mutate instead of summarize?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
group_by() %>% summarize()
group_by() %>% mutate()
```

Now let's say we want to calculate the percentage of fish type at each site. This means we are going to do a calculation using both the raw and summary data. And we're going to do it in 2 ways. 

I actually like to do this kind of calculation in a 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fish_counts %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  mutate(total_fish = sum(total_count)) %>%
  mutate(perc_fish = total_count/total_fish*100)
```



- **`select()`**: pick variables by their names

  `r htmltools::img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-select.png', width=300)`
    
- **`mutate()`**: create new variables with functions of existing variables 

  `r htmltools::img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-mutate.png', width=300)`
    
  

All dplyr verbs can be used in conjunction with `group_by()` which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. 

All dplyr verbs work similarly:

1. The first argument is a data frame.
2. The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using `$`.
3. The result is a new data frame.

Together these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result.
