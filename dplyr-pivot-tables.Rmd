# Dplyr and Pivot Tables {#pivot}

## Summary (a few sentences)

First of two chapters on data wrangling, here focused on pivot tables. 

## Objectives (more detailed, bulletpoints?)

- intro to wrangling with dplyr 
- learn select
- learn group_by + summarize for pivot tables
- emphasize reproducible research


## Resources

## Introduction / our analytical plan

We are going to continue with our analysis with the fish-counts data. So far, our RMarkdown has the following in the "setup" chunk: <!---TODO update after ch 3 complete --->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## attach libraries
library(tidyverse)

## read in data
fish_counts <- read_csv("fish_counts_curated.csv")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Teaching version
fish_counts <- read_csv("curation/fish_counts_curated.csv")
```

And we have explored the data by looking at some summary statistics and making a simple plot. Now, we are going to learn how to wrangle data in R, using the `dplyr` package which is included in the `tidyverse`. In this session, we'll focus on the functions in `dplyr` that operate like pivot tables.

This is because what we want to do with our fish_counts data is XXXXX. 

## What are pivot tables?

- what they are
- what they allow you to do

Let's talk about how this looks like in R. 

## dplyr for pivot tables

In R, we can use dplyr for pivot tables by using 2 main verbs in combination: `group_by` and `summarize`, and that's where we'll start. Then, we will learn 2 critical verbs that you will use all the time: `select` and `mutate`. Here is what this looks like:


`group_by` and `summarize` are the main ingredients for pivot tables: 

- **`group_by()`**: TODO: words here, screenshot without computed column!

  `r htmltools::img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-summarise.png', width=300)`

- **`summarize()`**: collapse many values down to a single summary 

  `r htmltools::img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-summarise.png', width=300)`
  

- **`select()`**: pick variables by their names

  `r htmltools::img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-select.png', width=300)`
    
- **`mutate()`**: create new variables with functions of existing variables 

  `r htmltools::img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-mutate.png', width=300)`
    
  

All dplyr verbs can be used in conjunction with `group_by()` which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group. 

All dplyr verbs work similarly:

1. The first argument is a data frame.
2. The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using `$`.
3. The result is a new data frame.

Together these properties make it easy to chain together multiple simple steps to achieve a complex result.


## Deep thought

group_by() %>% summarize() vs
group_by() %>% mutate()
