# Synthesis

## Summary (a few sentences)

In this session, we'll put together the skills that we've learned so far to create a new document from scratch, and learn a few new ways to import and work with spreadsheet data along the way.

## Objectives

- Create a new repo on GitHub
- Start a new R project, connected to the repo 
- Create a new R Markdown document 
- Attach necessary packages (`googlesheets4`, `tidyverse`)
- Read in data from a Google sheet with the `googlesheets4` package in R
- Basic data wrangling (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `separate`)
- Data visualization (`ggplot2`)

## Resources

- Googlesheets4 link

## Lessons

Lesson set up: 

- Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository called `sea-creature-synthesis`
- Clone the repo to create a version controlled project (remember, copy & paste the URL from the GitHub Clone / Download)
- Copy and paste the `fish_counts_curated.csv` and `lobster_abundance.csv` into the project folder
- Create a new R Markdown document within your `sea-creature-synthesis` project
- Knit your .Rmd to html, saving as `sb_sea_creatures.Rmd`




### Reading 

- Read in lobster data with googlesheets4
- Join with another existing data frame (or 2?)
- Pivoting
- Transforming / subsetting
- Grouping & summarizing (for means, sd, count)
- Make a table 
- Make a graph

Possible new things: 
complete() 

## Fun facts (quirky things) - making a note of these wherever possible for interest (little “Did you know?” sections)
