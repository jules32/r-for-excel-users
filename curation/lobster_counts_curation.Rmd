Curating the 'lobster counts' data into a perfect, tidy, ggplot-able CSV file. 

**Info:**

**Citation:**
NOTE: "Count values were given a NA (-99999) if: (1) data were not collected for a particular species, (2) a datasheet was lost or (3) poor underwater visibility prevented lobster from being surveyed" (from: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.17.33)

1. Get the raw data (updating all non-observed -99999's to NA):
```{r}

lobster_counts_raw <- read_csv("curation/lobster_counts.csv", na = "-99999")

```

2. Some basic cleaning (already in great shape): 
```{r}

lobster_counts <- lobster_counts_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(site = str_to_lower(site))

lobster_subset <- lobster_counts %>%
  uncount(count) %>%
  select(-area, -num_ao)
  #filter(year == 2016:2018) 



## explore
lobster_subset %>%
  filter(site == "ivee", 
         year == 2018)

sum(lobster_counts$count)


```

3. Some further curation testing (trying out different lobster subsets, etc.)
```{r}

# This is the final curated version (lobster_counts_curated.csv)
write_csv(lobster_subset, "curation/lobster_counts_curated.csv")

# Make a graph of the numbers by location, year & species?
# Probably want to work on this a bit more ()

ggplot(lobster_subset, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~site)

```
